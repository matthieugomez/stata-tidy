stata-tidy
===========

This is a basic implementation of the  [tidyr package](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) from R.
## gather
gather transforms a wide dataset into a long dataset (i.e. reshape long). The command takes a list of variables as argument. This list corresponds to variables to gather.

Use the option  `label`  to save the variable labels as a new variable

## spread
spread transforms a long dataset into a wide dataset (i.e. reshape wide). The command takes two variable names as argument. The first variable contains the new variable names. The second variable contains the new variable values.

## Installation
```
net install tidy, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthieugomez/tidy.ado/master/")
```

If you have a version of Stata < 13, you need to install it manually:
1. Click the "Download ZIP" button in the right column to download a zipfile. Extract it into a folder (e.g. ~/SOMEFOLDER)
2. Run: (changing SOMEFOLDER with whatever you picked)
	```
	cap ado uninstall tidy
	net install tidy, from("~/SOMEFOLDER")
	```
